# Higher Level Programming Projects
This repo contains all the projects that I have done in the alx-Holberton curriculum on Higher level programming.



## What Does High-Level Language (HLL) Mean?
A high-level language is a programming language that enables development of a computer program in a much more user-friendly programming context and is generally independent of the computer's hardware architecture.


A high-level language has a higher level of abstraction from the computer, and focuses more on the programming logic rather than the underlying hardware components such as memory addressing and register utilization.

Phython is the first Higher level programming Language we are going to start with
